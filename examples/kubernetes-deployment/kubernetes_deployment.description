//Ballerina supports generating kubernetes artifacts based on annotations.
//A single Ballerina module is mapped to a single Kubernetes deployment.
//Minikube or Docker for Mac/Windows should be configured and
//Kubernetes should be [enabled](https://github.com/ballerinax/kubernetes/tree/master/samples#prerequisites)
//to run the example.
//This example deploys https service which retrieve values from config file, to Kubernetes.
//Refer [Kubernetes samples](https://github.com/ballerinax/kubernetes/tree/master/samples) for more advanced use-cases.
