// The `fork` block allows you to start any number of parallel workers at once. Workers are visible outside the fork block as futures.
// These futures behave similar to the futures returned by asynchronous functions created by `start`. You may wait for the worker 
// returns using the `wait` expression.
// You can only send `anydata` variables from one fork worker to another worker in the same fork.
