// Workers within a fork can access the variables that are declared within the scope of that block.
// The variables can be value type variables or reference type variables.
// Value type variables such as `string`, `int`, `float`, and `byte` are passed into the workers as a copy
// of the original data. Therefore, you are able to update the value of it within the worker and that value is only
// defined within the specific worker.
// Reference type variables such as `map`, `json`, `xml`, and `record` are passed into these workers as a
// reference to the original data. Therefore, if you update the value of these variables within a worker, the value gets
// updated for the entire function. You may wait for the worker returns using the `wait` expression.
