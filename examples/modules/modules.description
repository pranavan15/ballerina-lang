// Ballerina program files have the `.bal` extension and the file names do not have semantics.
// These source files can be grouped into modules. The code within a module can refer to any module-level symbol (name) declared
// in the same module. Module names can only contain alphanumerics, underscores and periods and the maximum length is 256 characters.
