// Ballerina XA transactions are used when the transaction is happening over
// two or more databases. This sample uses two H2 DBs (these
// are created when running the sample). Before running the sample, 
// change the DB connection properties as required.
// Ballerina transactions are at experimental stage,
// please use  --experimental flag to enable them.
