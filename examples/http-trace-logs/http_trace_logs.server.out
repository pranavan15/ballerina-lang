# Trace logs are logged at `TRACE` level. 
# To enable trace logs, the log level has to be set to `TRACE` using the runtime argument: <br> '-e b7a.http.tracelog.console=true'. <br>
# To start the service, navigate to the directory that contains the
# `.bal` file and use the `ballerina run` command with this runtime argument.
$ ballerina run -e b7a.http.tracelog.console=true http_trace_logs.bal

# In the logs, `http.downstream` refers to the HTTP traffic that flows between the client and Ballerina, 
# while `http.upstream` refers to the HTTP traffic that flows between Ballerina and the backend.
