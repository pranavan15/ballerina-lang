// The `Optional Type` example demonstrates how to eliminate null reference errors by using optional types in Ballerina.
// This example demonstrates how to operate on optional typed variables.
// E.g., the `+` operator cannot operate on values of `int?` type. However, there are some operators that work on optional types.
// They are called lifted operators because they operate on optional types by lifting the operators that already exist on non-optional types.
