// Explicitly typed expressions specify a static type for an expression explicitly.
// For simple basic types, explicitly typed expressions result in conversions. Explicitly typed expressions are
// allowed between all combinations of simple basic types except for when the target type is not `string` for an
// expression of type `string`.
// For non-simple basic types, a type assertion would be done when a type is specified explicitly.
