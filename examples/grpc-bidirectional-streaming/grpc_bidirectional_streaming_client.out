$ ballerina grpc --input Chat.proto --output client

# Once you run the command, the following files will be generated inside client directory.
# * Chat_pb.bal
# * Chat_sample_client.bal
# Replace the content of Chat_sample_client.bal file with the content of grpc_bidirectional_streaming_client.bal file.

$ ballerina build client

# Run the client using the following command.
$ ballerina run target/client.balx
