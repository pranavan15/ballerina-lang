// A Ballerina transaction is a series of data manipulation statements 
// that must either fully complete or fully fail, thereby leaving the
// system in a consistent state. This sample demonstrates the usage of
// transaction local participants. If participant panics, even when it
// is trapped and initiator completes, the transaction is considered failure.
// Ballerina transactions are at experimental stage,
// please use  --experimental flag to enable them.
