// Projection involves selecting only some of the attributes from the input
// stream to be inserted into an output stream, renaming the attributes, adding
// constant values to the output stream, and performing logical or mathematical operations.
// In this example, events are related to the person being monitored and there will be a
// children's day wish triggered when there is a person found whose age is less
// than or equal to 16.
// Ballerina Streams is an experimental feature. Please use the `--experimental` flag when compiling Ballerina
// files that have streaming constructs.
