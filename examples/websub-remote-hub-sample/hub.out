# This sample requires the Hub Service to start via hub.bal prior to running the Publisher main program. The
# Subscriber Service needs to start after the publisher registers the topic at the hub.
# If the port is not specified, the hub service starts on the default port.
# To run this sample, navigate to the directory that contains the
# `.bal` file and issue the `ballerina run` command.
