# Create a Ballerina project and a module inside it.
# Add grpc_unary_blocking.bal file inside the module directory and
# build the project.
# For example, if you create a module named 'service', execute the following command to build
# the 'service' module.
$ ballerina build service

# Once you build the project, the following files will be generated inside target directory.
# * service.balx
# * grpc/HelloWorld.proto

# Run the service using the following command.
$ ballerina run target/service.balx
