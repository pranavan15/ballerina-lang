// Any `public` function can be an entry point to a Ballerina program. The function to be considered as the entry point
// could be specified with the ballerina `run` command. If a function is not specified with the ballerina `run` command,
// the `main` function is considered to be the entry point.
// Entry point functions can be data-binding, and can have zero or more parameters of any supported type, including any
// number of required/defaultable parameters and/or a single rest parameter. They could also return a value.
// To print the return value of such a function to the standard out stream, set the `--printreturn` option
// with the `run` command.
