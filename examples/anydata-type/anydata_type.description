// The `anydata` type consists of pure values whose basic type is not `error`. Thus the `anydata` type is
// equivalent to `boolean|int|float|decimal|string|xml|table|anydata[]|map<anydata>|()`.
// Although `json` and `byte` are not explicitly mentioned, they are subsets of the aforementioned union.
// The same is true of records where all the fields' types are subsets of `anydata`(including the rest field in open records).
// `anydata` variables can be used in places where you expect pure values (sans `error`).
